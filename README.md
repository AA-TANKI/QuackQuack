# QuackQuack
# Why did i make this specific app
### Well i always had a `problem` where if i want to open my **whatsapp** on the computer i'd need to connect it and sync and alot of stuff so i decided to make this `app` to solve this issue now you can `login` using your `phone number` and `password`.
# How it works
### As I said before you can sign up with the `password` and `phone number`. And then you can send `messages` to other users.
# Additional feutures
### You can also send messaeges and see them instantly `without refreshing` and also the other user can see these `messages` `instantly` thanks to the *real time chatting feuture*.
# How did i make it
### I used `HTMl` for basic pages and what they contain and also some `jinja` code in the `HTML` code. I also used `css` for basic styling and how the site looks like. I also used some `Bootstrap` libraries for additional `css` code and for typing less code. I also used the `Java script` for some code and basic `rediricting` that can't be done in other language. And I also used it for `displaying messages`.`Python` combined with `flask-socket io` was difiently used for `real time chatting feuture`. And I also used `SQL` library for storing the messages and users info like login credintals. the rest of the app was made by `flask`.

# Design
### it's not really the best design because i don't really know how to design `:(` but it gets the job done and for the name, overall i would rate my design 6/10 but the problem is that i know that my design is bad `BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO IMPROVE IT`.

# fetures that i could have added
### I really wanted to add a 3 main fetures but the problem is that it would be time consuming and i didn't have much time left.
## first feture `deleting messages`
### i really wanted to add a feture where you can delete messages but i got very lazy and also it would be time consuming .because I would need to know which user sent what because you shouldn't be able to delete messages that you didn't send.

## second feture `changing usernames`
### I didn't make this because the way that my database works is that it checks if the user with his specife name so if you were to change your name and go to a chat you wouldn't be able to see any messages because they aren't stored in the database so i would need to update all of the messages that was sent by that user to the new name

## third feture `changing pictures`
### if you would have noticed all users have default img. So for this one i'm not really sure how to store imgs in my data base and then show it to that specifec user i think that i would have needed to learn something new and as i said i didn't have much time.

# Problems that i faced while making this project
### I'm very happy to say that i didn't face that much issues. Except for one issue. So at first i thought of how could i do this real chatting time and then i searched and i founed that you need to use a library in python called `socket io` So i learned it, made the project, tested and got an error. that error presested with me no matter what i do i tried solving it i couldn't.  i went on youtube and i found that my code was actually correct. tho i still thought that my code is incorrect so i asked chat gpt to make a simple app like mine. but it was very simple so i run it and it doesn't work. and here i noticed that the codespace itself had an issue when i moved to vsc the code worked! but i discovered that after 2 to 3 days...........

# How to run the app
### follow the following steps in order to run this program:
1- open your terminal using `ctrl + ~` if it's already opened then skip this step.

2- type `cd "{file name}"` to open the folder

3- run the program using `python app.py`
### i don't really recommend running it using flask run becuase i faced a few issues when i did that. you are welcome to change my code or edit it to add more fetures or remove fetures. or if you are very fancy you can run this app on a domain

# Guide on using the app
### If it's your first time using then follow these steps:
### 1- singup for a new account choose your country and name and password
